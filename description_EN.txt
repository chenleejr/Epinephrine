Epinephrine

[h1]What is this[/h1]
This mod provides an item called Epinephrine, which can be found in medical related locations. After injection, the negative effects of injuries can be ignored for a short time.

When we encounter a wave of zombies and prepare to have a great fight, is it always because of a scratch or laceration caused by a zombie attack accidentally, causing the attack speed to become very slow and enter a vicious circle, or the too long entanglement time lead to lack of endurance and eventually dies? Try the Epinephrine!

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
[list]
     [*]Because Epinephrine is a new item, theoretically it will not conflict with other mod items.
     [*]But because I rewrote the code of the health panel to show whether the Epinephrine is in effect, it may conflict with other mods that modify the health panel.
